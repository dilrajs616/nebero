title: "K-Means with FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Procedure and Results"
---

## Overview

After trying traditional **K-Means** and **DBSCAN**, we implemented **K-Means with FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to improve clustering performance on large datasets. **FAISS K-Means** showed a **slight improvement in the Silhouette Score**, but cluster quality remained unsatisfactory.

## FAISS Overview

**FAISS** is a library by Facebook for fast similarity search and clustering, optimized for high-dimensional datasets. It offers:
- **Exact and Approximate K-Means** for performance vs accuracy tradeoffs.
- **Scalability** for large datasets, **GPU support**, and **Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search**.

## K-Means in FAISS: Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - We used **TF-IDF** to convert documents into high-dimensional vectors.
   - Preprocessing included **stop-word removal** and **normalization**.

2. **K-Means Initialization**:
   - Initialized **exact K-Means** in FAISS with the TF-IDF vectors.

3. **Indexing for Optimization**:
   - Utilized **Inverted File Index (IVF)** for faster nearest neighbor search.
   - **GPU acceleration** was available but unnecessary for this dataset.

4. **Clustering**:
   - Standard K-Means steps: assignment to centroids, centroid updates, iteration until convergence.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - **Silhouette Score** was calculated for cluster quality.
   - FAISS K-Means showed a slight improvement over traditional K-Means but remained low overall.

Example:
```python
import faiss

# Create index and perform clustering
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)  # Exact K-Means
faiss_kmeans = faiss.Kmeans(d=dim, k=num_clusters)
faiss_kmeans.train(tfidf_vectors)

# Get cluster labels and centroids
labels = faiss_kmeans.index.search(tfidf_vectors, 1)[1]
centroids = faiss_kmeans.centroids
```

## Results: FAISS vs Traditional K-Means

- **Traditional K-Means**: Silhouette Score = **0.2**
- **FAISS K-Means**: Slightly higher but still below ideal.

### Key Issues:
- **High-dimensional data** affects distance metrics, causing poor separation.
- **TF-IDF features** may not capture important aspectsâ€”potentially requiring **PCA** or feature refinement.
