**Week 10 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

In Week 10, the construction of the shopping mall continued to advance steadily, with the focus remaining on the vertical expansion of the structural framework and the preparation of key infrastructure elements.

At the beginning of the week, the construction team resumed the installation of steel columns and beams, working on completing the framework for the ground floor and the first level. This involved the use of cranes to lift the heavier steel components into position, followed by the workers welding and bolting the beams securely to the columns. I was responsible for monitoring the alignment of the framework, ensuring that each section was properly level and in line with the structural design plans. We paid extra attention to maintaining accuracy in this stage, as it would affect the installation of future floors and walls.

By midweek, we had progressed to laying the concrete floor slabs for the ground floor. The team prepared the rebar mesh to reinforce the concrete and ensure that the slabs would have the necessary structural strength. I worked closely with the site engineers to check that the rebar placement followed the engineering specifications, and we conducted inspections before the concrete was poured. Once the rebar was confirmed to be correctly installed, the concrete was poured and left to cure for the rest of the week. 

During the pouring process, I assisted with quality control, ensuring that the concrete mix met the specified strength and consistency requirements. The senior engineers and I took sample cubes of the concrete for compression tests to verify its strength after curing. This step was important in ensuring that the building would meet structural safety standards.

In parallel with the structural work, I also continued to collaborate with the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) teams. We focused on coordinating the installation of ductwork, plumbing lines, and electrical conduits that would run through the walls and floors of the building. Since the floor slabs were being laid, it was important to ensure that all embedded utilities were installed before the concrete work was completed. This required close communication between the construction team and the MEP contractors to avoid delays or issues later in the project.

By the end of Week 10, the structure of the ground floor and the first level was becoming more defined. The framework for the first floor was nearing completion, and we were preparing to continue upward with the next set of floors in the coming weeks. The project was still progressing on schedule, and we were closely monitoring the quality of the work to ensure that there were no issues that could cause delays down the line.

Overall, Week 10 marked significant progress in the construction of the mall, with the concrete flooring and steel framework advancing according to plan. The project continued to run smoothly, and the groundwork for future levels and systems was being laid effectively.
