In the tenth week of my internship, the construction work progressed with a focus on completing the third-floor columns and initiating preparations for the third-floor slab. Hereâ€™s a brief summary of the key activities during Week 10:

### **1. Concrete Pouring for Third-Floor Columns:**
We completed the concrete pouring for the third-floor columns. The steel reinforcement was already in place from the previous week, and the concrete used was **M25 grade**, consistent with the previous floors. Approximately **70 cubic meters** of concrete was poured. The process involved proper compaction and vibration to ensure the columns were structurally sound. The curing process began right after the pouring to maintain strength and durability.

### **2. Formwork for the Third-Floor Slab:**
Once the columns were set, we started preparing the formwork for the third-floor slab. The formwork consisted of **plywood sheets and steel props**, designed to hold the weight of the concrete during the pouring process. The formwork installation also accounted for openings for services like staircases, elevator shafts, and utility ducts.

### **3. Reinforcement for the Third-Floor Slab:**
Simultaneously, we worked on laying the steel reinforcement for the third-floor slab. The slab was designed to be **200mm thick**, with **12mm TMT steel bars** arranged in a grid pattern, spaced **200mm apart**. Additional reinforcement was placed around load-bearing areas like columns and beams.

### **4. Coordination with MEP Teams:**
We continued coordination with the MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) teams to ensure that all necessary conduits, pipes, and service provisions were installed before pouring the slab. This included **PVC conduits for electrical wiring** and **GI pipes for plumbing**. The coordination ensured that the structural work and service installations were integrated smoothly.

### **5. Curing Process for the Third-Floor Columns:**
The columns that were poured earlier in the week underwent the curing process. This included keeping the columns moist with regular water application and covering them to prevent rapid moisture loss, which could affect the concrete's strength.

### **6. Site Safety and Inspections:**
Regular site safety inspections were conducted to ensure all workers followed the safety protocols, especially those working at higher elevations. Scaffolding stability and fall protection measures were a top priority.

By the end of Week 10, the third-floor columns were fully completed, and the formwork and reinforcement for the third-floor slab were nearly ready for concrete pouring in the coming weeks. The project remained on schedule, with work progressing steadily towards the upper floors.
