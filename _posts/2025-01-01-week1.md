**Week 1 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

During the first week of my internship, I familiarized myself with the project scope and objectives. My task was to assist the senior engineers in planning the construction of a shopping mall. I spent most of the week understanding the architectural blueprints, getting a basic overview of the site layout, and reviewing the initial design concepts provided by the team.

I attended meetings with project managers and site supervisors to understand the key requirements and constraints, such as the mall's total area, number of floors, and parking spaces. I also took part in discussions regarding the selection of construction materials and preliminary cost estimates. Towards the end of the week, I began working on drafting the basic floor plans using AutoCAD, focusing on the layout of the ground floor and initial structural requirements.

Overall, this week was largely dedicated to orientation, understanding the project's scope, and starting with some basic design work. It set the foundation for the upcoming tasks related to detailed planning and execution.
