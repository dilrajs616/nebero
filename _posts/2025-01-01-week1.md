In the first week of my internship, the focus was on familiarizing myself with the project and understanding the fundamental requirements for constructing the shopping mall. I spent the week reviewing the architectural drawings, project specifications, and overall design plans. My tasks included:

- **Project Briefing:** I attended meetings with the project manager and senior engineers to understand the scope, timeline, and expectations for the construction of the shopping mall.
- **Site Layout Review:** I examined the site plan, which covered approximately **50,000 square feet**, and reviewed the basic layout of the mall, including the parking area, retail units, and service areas.
- **Initial Calculations:** I began working on basic load calculations for the structure, ensuring that the design adhered to local building codes and safety standards.
- **Material Review:** I reviewed the materials proposed for the foundation, columns, beams, and roofing, discussing possible alternatives to ensure cost-effectiveness without compromising quality.

The week was mainly about getting familiar with the project's overall structure and starting preliminary technical work, setting the foundation for the weeks to come.
