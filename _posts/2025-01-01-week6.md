title: "Week 6"

In the sixth week of my internship, we continued progressing with the structural work on the shopping mall, focusing on the columns and preparing for the construction of the first-floor slab. Here's a summary of the key activities and progress made during Week 6:

### **1. Erecting the Columns:**
Following the completion of the raft foundation, the next step was erecting the reinforced concrete columns. The steel cages for the columns that were prepared in Week 5 were placed in position, and the formwork was assembled around them. We proceeded with the concrete pouring for the first set of columns, which extended from the foundation to the ground floor level. The concrete used was **M25 grade**, consistent with the rest of the structure. Approximately **50 cubic meters** of concrete was poured for the columns this week. 

The columns were carefully aligned using plumb lines to ensure vertical accuracy. I monitored the pouring process, ensuring proper compaction using vibrators to avoid any voids in the columns. The columns would take a few days to set before the formwork could be removed.

### **2. Preparing for the First-Floor Slab:**
With the columns in place, the focus shifted to preparing the formwork and reinforcement for the first-floor slab. The slab was designed to be **200mm thick**, and we used **12mm TMT steel bars** for reinforcement, arranged in a grid with **200mm spacing**. I assisted in checking the slab reinforcement layout to ensure that it conformed to the structural drawings and that adequate support was provided around areas with heavy loads, such as the escalators and atriums.

We also planned for additional support beams under the slab, which were designed to be **300mm x 500mm** in dimension. These beams would help distribute the load evenly across the columns.

### **3. Formwork Setup for the Slab:**
The formwork for the first-floor slab was set up using **plywood sheets** supported by **adjustable steel props** to hold the weight of the concrete during the pouring process. The formwork was designed to ensure a smooth finish for the underside of the slab, which would later serve as the ceiling of the ground floor. I reviewed the formwork plan to ensure that it accounted for all openings required for services like HVAC ducts, electrical wiring, and plumbing, which would be installed later.

### **4. Electrical and Plumbing Coordination:**
During the preparation for the slab, we coordinated with the electrical and plumbing teams to ensure that all necessary conduits and pipes were laid before the slab was poured. This included running **PVC conduits** for electrical wiring and **GI pipes** for water supply, ensuring that all services were integrated into the structure without requiring significant changes later on.

### **5. Curing and Strength Testing:**
The columns poured earlier in the week were subjected to a curing process to ensure they reached their full strength. This involved keeping the columns moist and covering them with hessian cloth to retain water. We also conducted **compressive strength tests** on the concrete cubes taken during the column pouring, and the initial results showed the concrete had reached approximately **70% of its final strength** within the first 7 days.

### **6. Material Management and Planning:**
I assisted in managing the procurement of materials for the upcoming stages of construction. This included ordering additional **300 tons of TMT steel bars** and **500 cubic meters of concrete** for the slab and beams. I worked with the site supervisors to schedule deliveries to align with the construction timeline and ensure that there were no delays due to material shortages.

### **7. Site Safety and Progress Review:**
As construction activity ramped up, we conducted regular safety briefings to reinforce the importance of proper handling of materials and machinery. With work progressing on multiple levels of the structure, fall protection measures such as guardrails and safety nets were put in place around the edges of the slab formwork.

By the end of Week 6, the columns for the ground floor were completed, and preparations for the first-floor slab were well underway. This week marked another significant step forward, with the vertical structure starting to take shape and preparations for the upper floors in motion.
