**Week 6 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

In Week 6 of my internship, I focused heavily on further developing the construction timeline and finalizing some important design details, particularly concerning the mall's interior spaces. The goal was to start preparing for the construction phase while ensuring that every design element was practical and cost-effective.

The first task of the week was revisiting the construction phasing plan I started in Week 5. I spent time refining the timeline with more specific details about how the mall's construction would progress over the next several months. I worked with the construction team to prioritize the foundational work and the installation of key structural elements (like columns and beams) so that other activities, such as plumbing and electrical work, could run smoothly afterward. We made sure the timeline accounted for any delays that might occur, such as procurement issues or weather disruptions, by building in buffer periods. 

The next part of my focus this week was on the mall's interior layout, particularly in terms of optimizing the space for retail units and common areas. I revisited the floor plans for the retail shops, ensuring that the spaces were functional and aligned with standard retail requirements. For example, I adjusted the sizes of some units to offer flexibility for different types of stores, ranging from small kiosks to large anchor tenants. Additionally, I revised the layout of walkways to ensure smooth foot traffic throughout the mall and to avoid congested areas.

Another important task this week was working with the interior design team to finalize decisions regarding floor materials, wall finishes, and ceiling designs. We reviewed a number of materials for their durability, maintenance costs, and overall aesthetic appeal. I helped compile a shortlist of materials for flooring in high-traffic areas, such as polished concrete, marble, and tiles, and we considered cost versus longevity in making the final selection. We also discussed the use of glass for interior partitions to give the mall a more open, airy feel.

Midweek, I met with the HVAC and electrical teams to go over the design for the mall's ventilation and lighting systems. We made decisions about the types of lighting to be used in different areas, such as soft ambient lighting for common areas and brighter task lighting for the retail stores. The HVAC system was also mapped out in more detail, ensuring that air conditioning units were positioned in a way that maximized efficiency without disrupting the overall design. We paid particular attention to the food court and entertainment areas, which would need stronger ventilation due to higher occupancy levels.

Towards the end of the week, I also worked on updating the Revit model with these changes to the interior design, materials, and utility layouts. This helped visualize the progress and made it easier to present to the senior engineers and project managers. They appreciated the level of detail and the realistic timeline, though they also suggested keeping a close eye on material procurement to avoid any delays in the later phases.

By the end of Week 6, the construction timeline was mostly finalized, and the interior layouts were well on their way to being completed. However, further coordination with the procurement team and a few last-minute design refinements were still needed, so my focus for the next few weeks would shift towards ensuring everything was ready for the start of physical construction.
