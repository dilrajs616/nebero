title: "K-Means and DBSCAN Clustering: Detailed Procedure and Silhouette Score"
---

Here's a streamlined version of the documentation, focusing only on the steps you took as a developer. I also added an example for clarity:

## Overview

This section documents the process we followed to apply **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** clustering algorithms to our dataset, and how we evaluated their performance using the **Silhouette Score**. Despite experimenting with both algorithms, the clustering results were not ideal, with the best **Silhouette Score** being **0.2** from K-Means.

## K-Means Clustering

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Preprocessing**: Performed feature extraction using TF-IDF, stop-word removal, and data normalization.
2. **Choosing K**: Experimented with values of **k** from 20 to 200, ultimately using **k=107** for further evaluation.
3. **Fitting the Model**: Applied K-Means with **k=10**.
4. **Evaluation**: Calculated the **Silhouette Score** for K-Means, which was **0.2**, indicating weak cluster separation.

#### Example:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Example of fitting K-Means and calculating the Silhouette Score
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=107, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(data)
labels = kmeans.labels_
score = silhouette_score(data, labels)

print(f"Silhouette Score: {score}")
```

## DBSCAN Clustering

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Preprocessing**: Applied the same preprocessing steps as in K-Means.
2. **Choosing Parameters**: Started with **eps=0.5** and **min_samples=5**.
3. **Fitting the Model**: Ran DBSCAN on the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluation**: The **Silhouette Score** for DBSCAN was lower than 0.2, with the model either detecting too few clusters or classifying too many points as noise.

#### Example:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Example of fitting DBSCAN and calculating the Silhouette Score
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=0.5, min_samples=5)
dbscan.fit(data)
labels = dbscan.labels_
score = silhouette_score(data, labels)

print(f"Silhouette Score: {score}")
```
