title: "Week 4"

In the fourth week of my internship, we made significant progress in transitioning from the design phase to preparing for the actual construction work. The focus was on completing the final touches for the foundation and structural designs while also beginning to prepare the site for the construction of the shopping mall. Hereâ€™s a summary of the work done during Week 4:

### **1. Site Preparation for Construction:**
Site preparation activities were in full swing this week. We finalized the earthwork, ensuring that the site was fully leveled and graded. The excavation work for the foundation was completed, with roughly **200 cubic meters** of soil removed and disposed of. Temporary drainage systems were also installed to manage stormwater and prevent flooding during the foundation laying process.

### **2. Formwork Design and Setup:**
I began working on the design and layout for the formwork, which would be used to cast the concrete for the foundation, columns, and beams. We opted for a **steel formwork** system, as it would provide the necessary strength and reusability for different phases of the project. The formwork was designed to accommodate the **1.5-meter** thick foundation and ensure that all edges and reinforcements were properly set. I assisted the senior engineers in preparing the detailed formwork drawings and plans.

### **3. Steel Reinforcement Planning:**
The steel reinforcement work for the foundation began this week. Based on the finalized foundation design, we planned for **16mm and 20mm TMT steel bars** to be used as reinforcement in the foundation. The steel reinforcement bars were placed in a grid pattern with **300mm** spacing to ensure maximum load distribution. I was involved in inspecting and verifying the placement of steel bars to ensure that they conformed to the structural drawings.

### **4. Concrete Mix Design:**
We finalized the concrete mix design for the foundation and the first phase of the structural framework. The mix was specified as **M25 grade concrete** with a water-cement ratio of **0.45**. We conducted cube tests to check the strength of the concrete, and the results indicated that the concrete would meet the required compressive strength of **25 MPa**. I also reviewed the supply chain for ready-mix concrete to ensure timely deliveries during the pouring of the foundation.

### **5. Coordination with Utility Teams:**
As part of the preparation for the construction phase, I coordinated with the utility teams to plan for the installation of basic services such as water supply, electricity, and temporary site offices. This coordination was important to ensure that the construction workers would have access to essential services throughout the duration of the project.

### **6. Safety Measures and Site Inspection:**
We conducted a detailed site inspection to ensure that all safety protocols were in place before starting major construction activities. Temporary fencing and signage were installed around the site to prevent unauthorized access. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was made available to the workers, and we held a safety briefing to educate everyone about the potential hazards on-site, such as handling heavy equipment and working at heights.

### **7. Pouring the Foundation:**
By the end of the week, we were ready to begin pouring the concrete for the raft foundation. The formwork and steel reinforcement were in place, and all necessary inspections had been completed. We planned the concrete pouring to take place over two days in the following week to ensure that the concrete would be laid evenly and without interruptions. This marked a major milestone in the project, as the foundation is one of the most critical stages of construction.

Overall, Week 4 was a key step in transitioning from design to execution. With the site prepared, formwork and reinforcement in place, and the concrete mix finalized, we were fully ready to move into the actual construction phase in the coming weeks.
