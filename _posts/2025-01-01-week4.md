**Week 4 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

In the fourth week of my internship, I continued progressing on the upper floors of the shopping mall, while also starting to dive into more specific details such as structural reinforcement, materials, and preliminary cost estimates.

At the beginning of the week, I finalized the general layout of the first and second floors, incorporating feedback from the previous week's review meeting. This included optimizing the food court design to ensure a more spacious seating area and easy access to escalators and restrooms. Additionally, I worked on enhancing the entertainment zones on the upper floors, ensuring proper zoning for different activities, including a cinema and children’s play area. These changes were updated in the AutoCAD and Revit models to reflect the new plans.

A significant focus this week was coordinating with the structural engineers to address load distribution across the mall. We concentrated on ensuring that the columns and beams were positioned strategically to handle the weight of both the upper floors and the roof. The roof, which would house HVAC units, required specific reinforcements, so we ran through structural simulations to confirm that the load-bearing capacities would be sufficient. I assisted in generating these simulations and reviewed the results with the team to identify any potential weak points that needed attention.

Moreover, I worked on material selection for different parts of the building. I began by researching various flooring options for the retail spaces, food court, and entertainment areas, keeping in mind durability, aesthetics, and cost. I presented several options to the senior engineers, who provided feedback based on cost and maintenance concerns. We also discussed the types of windows and skylights that would be used to maximize natural lighting throughout the mall. This was important not just for aesthetics but also for reducing energy consumption, something the project manager emphasized as part of our sustainability goals.

Midweek, I began working on a preliminary cost estimate for the project. This included estimating the cost of key materials like concrete, steel, glass, and HVAC systems. While this was just an initial estimate, it gave the project managers a rough idea of the budget, which they would refine as more details were finalized. I learned how to balance the need for quality materials with the project’s budget constraints, which was an important takeaway from this task.

In addition to material and cost considerations, I also collaborated with the plumbing team to ensure proper routing for water and drainage systems, especially around the food court and restroom areas. This was an important step to ensure that all utility systems were properly aligned and wouldn't disrupt the architectural design.

By the end of the week, I completed the initial draft of the upper floors and roof plan, along with a preliminary cost estimate. I presented the updated designs to the senior engineers for review and received feedback on areas to improve, particularly around the roof's structural reinforcements and material selection for high-traffic areas.

Overall, Week 4 involved a deeper dive into detailed planning, material selection, and early-stage budgeting. The designs were progressing well, but more refinement and coordination with other teams would be necessary in the upcoming weeks to ensure all elements of the project were integrated smoothly.
