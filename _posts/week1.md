### **Weekly Internship Report – Week 1**

#### **Project: Construction of a Shopping Mall**

**Duration:** 26 Weeks  
**Completed:** 11 Weeks  
**Week 1 Report:** (Duration: 5 Days)

---

#### **Introduction:**

In the first week of my internship, my focus was on understanding the fundamental aspects of the shopping mall project and laying the groundwork for the planning and design phase. Since this was the initial week of my 26-week internship, the objective was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements, familiarize myself with the site location, and perform preliminary tasks that would set the foundation for the future weeks. 

The shopping mall is planned to cover a **50,000 square meter** area, with two levels of underground parking and three above-ground floors dedicated to retail spaces. The total built-up area will be **150,000 square meters**, with a mix of retail stores, entertainment zones, food courts, and utility services. The first week involved gathering all necessary data and performing various assessments and analyses.

#### **1. Site Visit and Preliminary Survey:**

The first task for the week was a **detailed site visit** to the proposed location of the shopping mall. The site is located in an urban area, surrounded by mixed-use developments. The plot itself is relatively flat, but adjacent to a slightly inclined roadway, which required us to consider the natural topography in our design. The following activities were performed during the site visit:

- **Topographical Survey:**
  - We collected elevation data for the entire plot using **Total Station** and **GPS Surveying** equipment.
  - The highest point on the site was recorded at **92.5 meters** above sea level, while the lowest point was **90.1 meters**.
  - These elevation differences of **2.4 meters** will need to be considered in the excavation and foundation design to ensure stability and drainage.

- **Soil Testing:**
  - Preliminary soil sampling was conducted at three different points to assess the soil's load-bearing capacity.
  - The results showed a **bearing capacity of 180 kN/m²**, which is sufficient for the construction of a multi-story building with underground parking.
  - The soil predominantly consists of sandy clay, and groundwater levels were noted at **3 meters below ground level**, which would need to be managed during the construction phase, especially during foundation and basement work.

#### **2. Understanding the Project Requirements:**

After the site visit, I focused on reviewing the **architectural drawings** and **client requirements** for the shopping mall. The client envisions a modern and sustainable design, which meant our engineering plans would need to prioritize:

- **Green Building Standards:**
  - The design will incorporate **LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)** certification standards. This includes the use of energy-efficient systems, rainwater harvesting, and low-emission construction materials.
  - The goal is to reduce the mall's energy consumption by **30%** compared to traditional structures and maximize the use of natural light in common areas.

- **Space Planning:**
  - The total built-up area of **150,000 square meters** will be divided into:
    - **Retail Spaces** (60% of total area)
    - **Entertainment Zones** (15%)
    - **Food Courts and Restaurants** (10%)
    - **Utility Services and Storage** (10%)
    - **Other Facilities** (5%)

- **Parking Facilities:**
  - A two-level underground parking facility with a capacity of **2,500 cars** was proposed. A **10-meter excavation** is required for the underground levels.
  - A parking ratio of **5 spaces per 100 square meters** of retail space is planned to accommodate the expected volume of visitors.

#### **3. Initial Conceptual Design Discussion:**

The next focus of the week was on collaborating with the architects and structural engineers to understand the **initial design concept** of the shopping mall. I participated in a series of meetings where the following key elements were discussed:

- **Structural Design:**
  - The mall will be constructed using a **reinforced concrete frame structure** with steel beams supporting larger open areas such as the food court and atrium.
  - A **slab-on-grade foundation** will be used for the ground floor, while deeper pile foundations will support the heavier load areas such as the parking and atrium.

- **Load Analysis:**
  - I assisted the structural team in performing initial **dead load** and **live load** calculations.
  - The estimated dead load due to the building's own weight is calculated to be approximately **5.8 kN/m²**, and the live load for retail areas was estimated to be **4 kN/m²**.
  - These figures will be refined in the upcoming weeks based on the final design specifications.

- **Material Selection:**
  - Discussion about using high-strength concrete (M35 grade) for critical structural elements like columns and shear walls to ensure durability and seismic resistance.
  - Sustainable building materials, including **recycled steel** for beams and **low VOC (volatile organic compounds)** paints and coatings, were considered in the context of LEED certification.

#### **4. Coordination with Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) Teams:**

In the latter part of the week, I engaged with the MEP engineers to ensure that the building's design would adequately accommodate the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. These systems play a crucial role in the operation of the mall, and their planning must be integrated with the structural design from the early stages:

- **HVAC Planning:**
  - The HVAC system design will include energy-efficient cooling solutions with **Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF)** systems.
  - The mall will require approximately **5,000 tons of air conditioning**, and zoning will be planned to optimize energy use in different areas.

- **Fire Safety:**
  - I assisted in drafting the layout for **fire exits** and **sprinkler systems** to comply with local building codes.
  - The design must meet the requirement of providing fire exits within **45 meters** of any location inside the building.

#### **Conclusion:**

In the first week of the internship, I successfully completed the preliminary site visit, surveyed the land, and gathered vital data such as topography, soil conditions, and groundwater levels. I also reviewed the architectural plans and collaborated with the design and engineering teams to understand the structural and MEP requirements. The initial week laid the foundation for the technical planning and design work that will follow in the upcoming weeks.

This was a critical week as it provided me with a deep understanding of the project’s scope, the structural and environmental considerations, and the interdisciplinary coordination required to achieve the design goals. The knowledge and skills I gained in this week will be instrumental in guiding my work throughout the remainder of my internship.
