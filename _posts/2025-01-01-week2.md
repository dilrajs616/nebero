### **Weekly Internship Report – Week 2**

#### **Project: Construction of a Shopping Mall**

**Duration:** 26 Weeks  
**Completed:** 11 Weeks  
**Week 2 Report:** (Duration: 5 Days)

---

#### **Introduction:**

During the second week of my internship, the focus shifted towards the **detailed structural analysis and design** of the shopping mall. After collecting the necessary data in Week 1, we began working on load distribution, structural integrity, and material specifications. This involved extensive calculations and collaboration with structural engineers. Additionally, I was involved in reviewing and fine-tuning the **foundation design** based on the soil test results and other site conditions that were gathered earlier.

#### **1. Detailed Structural Analysis:**

##### **1.1 Load Calculation:**
The first task of the week was to determine the **total loads** acting on the structure. This included **dead load, live load, wind load, and seismic load**. Below is a detailed breakdown of the loads:

- **Dead Load (DL):**
  The dead load is the self-weight of the structural components, which includes the walls, columns, beams, floors, and roofs. For the mall, the following values were used for dead load calculations:
  
  | Structural Element        | Unit Weight (kN/m²) |
  |---------------------------|--------------------|
  | Concrete Slab (150mm thick)| 3.75               |
  | Flooring (tiles)           | 1.00               |
  | Partition Walls (Brick)    | 2.00               |
  | Roof (insulated panels)    | 2.00               |
  | Total Dead Load            | **8.75 kN/m²**     |
  
  Therefore, the **total dead load** on the building was calculated using the above values.

  Example of Dead Load Calculation for a typical floor area of **1000 m²**:

  \[
  \text{Dead Load} = 8.75 \, \text{kN/m²} \times 1000 \, \text{m²} = 8750 \, \text{kN}
  \]

- **Live Load (LL):**
  The live load includes the weight of people, furniture, equipment, and other movable objects. Based on the usage (commercial spaces), the live load values were as follows:

  | Space Type       | Live Load (kN/m²) |
  |------------------|-------------------|
  | Retail Areas      | 4.0               |
  | Food Courts       | 3.5               |
  | Parking Areas     | 2.5               |
  | Roof Areas        | 1.5               |

  The **live load for retail spaces** (which form the majority of the area) was **4 kN/m²**. For an average retail space of 1000 m², the live load was calculated as:

  \[
  \text{Live Load} = 4 \, \text{kN/m²} \times 1000 \, \text{m²} = 4000 \, \text{kN}
  \]

- **Wind Load (WL):**
  Wind load is critical for tall buildings. Given the height of the mall (**18 meters** from the ground level), wind load calculations were performed as per IS 875 (Part 3) using the following parameters:
  
  - Basic Wind Speed: **47 m/s** (as per local wind conditions)
  - Exposure Factor: **0.85** (for buildings in suburban areas)
  - Wind Pressure Coefficient (Cpw): **1.2**
  
  The wind load acting on the building was calculated using the formula:

  \[
  \text{Wind Load (WL)} = 0.6 \times V^2 \times C_{pw}
  \]

  Substituting the values:

  \[
  \text{WL} = 0.6 \times (47)^2 \times 1.2 = 1584 \, \text{N/m²}
  \]

  For an exposed side wall area of **1000 m²**, the total wind load would be:

  \[
  \text{Wind Load} = 1584 \, \text{N/m²} \times 1000 \, \text{m²} = 1584000 \, \text{N} = 1584 \, \text{kN}
  \]

- **Seismic Load (SL):**
  As the mall is located in a **seismic zone III** (medium risk zone), seismic load calculations were done using IS 1893-2016. For a structure with an importance factor of **1.5**, and a response reduction factor of **5**, the seismic base shear was calculated using the following formula:

  \[
  \text{Base Shear (V)} = \frac{Z \cdot I \cdot S_A}{R} \cdot W
  \]

  Where:
  - **Z** = Seismic zone factor (0.16 for Zone III)
  - **I** = Importance factor (1.5 for public buildings)
  - **S_A** = Spectral acceleration coefficient
  - **R** = Response reduction factor (5 for RC moment-resisting frames)
  - **W** = Total weight of the structure

  The total seismic force calculated for the mall was around **5500 kN**.

#### **2. Foundation Design Refinement:**

Based on the results of the load analysis, the next step was to work on refining the **foundation design**. Given the soil’s bearing capacity of **180 kN/m²** (as determined in Week 1), the foundation system had to ensure that the pressure transmitted to the soil did not exceed this value.

The foundation type chosen was a **pile foundation**, considering the high load requirements and the presence of groundwater at a depth of **3 meters**. The pile depth was determined to be **12 meters** to ensure adequate load transfer to the underlying strata. 

##### **Pile Load Capacity Calculation:**
For **reinforced concrete piles** with a diameter of **600 mm** (0.6 meters), the pile load capacity (P) was calculated using the following formula:

\[
P = \pi \times D \times L \times q_u
\]

Where:
- **D** = Diameter of the pile (0.6 meters)
- **L** = Length of the pile (12 meters)
- **q_u** = Unit end bearing resistance

Substituting the values:

\[
P = \pi \times 0.6 \times 12 \times 180 = 4071 \, \text{kN}
\]

Each pile can carry approximately **4071 kN**, and based on the total load of the structure, the number of piles required was calculated to be around **80 piles** for the foundation, distributed evenly to balance the load.

#### **3. Materials Estimation and Cost Analysis:**

In the latter part of the week, I worked with the procurement team to estimate the materials required for the foundation and superstructure. A rough **Bill of Quantities (BoQ)** was prepared for the foundation stage. Here are the key materials and quantities:

| Material          | Quantity (for foundation) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Cement (M35 grade)| 1200 tons                  |
| Steel (Rebars)    | 600 tons                   |
| Aggregate         | 5000 cubic meters          |
| Sand              | 2500 cubic meters          |
| Concrete          | 4000 cubic meters          |

Additionally, a preliminary **cost analysis** was performed for the materials:

- **Cement:** ₹5,000 per ton → Total = ₹6,000,000
- **Steel (Rebars):** ₹60,000 per ton → Total = ₹36,000,000
- **Concrete:** ₹6,000 per cubic meter → Total = ₹24,000,000

The **total estimated cost** for the foundation materials amounted to approximately **₹66,000,000**.

#### **4. Design Software Utilization:**

Throughout the week, I used **ETABS** and **STAAD Pro** for structural analysis and design verification. These tools helped ensure that the load distribution and foundation designs were accurate and compliant with local building codes. I learned how to model the mall structure in ETABS, apply various loads, and simulate different scenarios (e.g., seismic events and wind conditions).

#### **Conclusion:**

The second week of the internship involved detailed calculations and analysis focused on structural integrity and load-bearing capacity. I collaborated with the structural engineering team to calculate the total loads, refine the foundation design, and perform preliminary cost estimation for materials. This was a crucial step to ensure that the project was on the right track in terms of both safety and cost-effectiveness. The knowledge gained this week, particularly in load calculations and foundation design, will be critical for future stages of the project.
