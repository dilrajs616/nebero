In the second week of my internship, I began diving deeper into the structural planning and preliminary designs for the shopping mall. The primary focus this week was on foundation design, site preparation, and continuing with load analysis. Here's an overview of the progress made:

### **1. Foundation Planning:**
I worked closely with the senior civil engineers to understand the soil conditions and how they would impact the foundation design. We received a geotechnical report that showed the soil type to be **clayey loam**, with a bearing capacity of around **150 kN/m²**. Based on this, we decided to go ahead with a **reinforced concrete raft foundation** to ensure stability across the entire mall site. The load from the multi-story structure was calculated, and initial estimates for the foundation thickness were around **1.2 meters**.

### **2. Site Preparation:**
I reviewed the site leveling plans and earthwork that would be required before construction could begin. The site had some uneven terrain, so approximately **200 cubic meters** of soil needed to be excavated and graded to make it suitable for laying the foundation. I also worked on ensuring that drainage systems were planned in such a way that rainwater wouldn’t affect construction or the foundation during later stages.

### **3. Load Analysis:**
I continued working on basic load analysis calculations for the mall’s structure. This included both **dead loads** (permanent loads like the weight of the structure itself) and **live loads** (temporary loads like people, furniture, and equipment). I started determining the distribution of these loads across the columns and foundation. The total dead load for the structure was roughly estimated to be **5000 kN** for the initial calculations, and live load requirements were set in accordance with the local building code at **3.0 kN/m²** for commercial spaces.

### **4. Material Planning and Sourcing:**
We began reviewing the materials required for the early phases of construction. For the foundation, the concrete mix was specified as **M25 grade**, with **500 tons** of cement, **1200 tons** of sand, and **1800 tons** of aggregates being estimated for the foundation and site work in the initial stages. I also started working with the procurement team to understand sourcing strategies and cost estimations.

Overall, Week 2 was about transitioning from the planning phase to detailed foundation design and preparation. The work done this week helped lay the groundwork for the more detailed design and construction processes to come.
