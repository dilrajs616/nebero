**Week 2 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

During the second week of my internship, I focused on further developing and refining the work that began in the first week, primarily working on the ground floor layout and ensuring that it aligned with the overall project requirements. I dedicated time to studying the design brief more thoroughly, which included understanding space optimization for retail stores, common areas, and customer flow. The goal was to ensure a functional and efficient layout that could handle foot traffic while maximizing the commercial viability of the space.

In collaboration with the senior engineers, I adjusted the placement of key elements like the main entrance, corridors, and retail units to ensure that the mall had a logical and convenient flow. This involved studying how customers would navigate the space, identifying high-traffic zones, and placing stores in locations that would maximize visibility for businesses while maintaining ease of movement for shoppers. 

Additionally, a significant portion of my time was spent discussing and planning the placement of essential services, such as escalators, elevators, restrooms, and emergency exits. This required coordination with the safety engineers to ensure compliance with safety codes and regulations, especially for fire exits and evacuation routes. I also collaborated with the electrical and mechanical teams to begin planning for HVAC systems (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), as well as the routing of electrical systems throughout the building. The focus was on making sure that the placement of these systems would not interfere with the architectural layout but still provide full coverage for the buildingâ€™s needs.

Another task I worked on during the second week was reviewing local building codes and regulations in greater depth. This included studying requirements for building height, setback from roads, parking space allocation, and fire safety measures. I ensured that the ground floor design met all these guidelines and started flagging any potential issues for the upcoming floors. Since the mall was intended to accommodate large numbers of visitors, it was critical to adhere to all safety regulations.

Towards the end of the week, I began working on a 3D model of the ground floor in Revit to visualize the layout in a more realistic manner. This helped in identifying areas where adjustments were needed, such as window placements for natural lighting and potential bottlenecks in customer movement. The 3D model also served as a visual aid for discussions with the project team in our weekly review meetings, where we reviewed the current progress and identified changes to be made in the coming weeks.

Overall, the second week was a mix of refining design plans, ensuring compliance with safety standards and building codes, and collaborating with different teams to make sure the project remained on track. There was steady progress, but plenty of detailed work still needed to be done, particularly with the upper floors and structural planning.
