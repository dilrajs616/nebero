title: "Step 1: Web Scraping"
---

In this phase of the project, I explored and implemented various web scraping tools to extract content from websites. The goal was to determine the most efficient way to scrape both static and dynamic content while dealing with anti-scraping mechanisms.

## 1. Requests Library

### What I Did:
I started with the `requests` library for basic web scraping of static content. It was effective for fetching HTML content from websites that didn't rely on JavaScript.

### Code Example:
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://example.com")
html_content = response.text
```

### Limitations:
- Couldn't handle dynamic content that required JavaScript rendering.

## 2. Pyppeteer

### What I Did:
To handle websites that required JavaScript execution, I implemented `pyppeteer`. It allowed me to simulate human interactions, such as clicking buttons and waiting for dynamic content to load.

### Code Example:
```python
from pyppeteer import launch

async def fetch_content():
    browser = await launch(headless=True)
    page = await browser.newPage()
    await page.goto("https://example.com")
    content = await page.content()
    await browser.close()
    return content
```

### Observations:
- Successfully scraped dynamic content but was slower due to launching a full browser.
- Encountered reliability issues with complex anti-scraping mechanisms.

## 3. Selenium

### What I Did:
I tested `Selenium` to automate a full browser, which allowed interaction with JavaScript-heavy websites. It was useful for websites requiring form submissions or clicks to load data.

### Code Example:
```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
driver.get("https://example.com")
content = driver.page_source
driver.quit()
```

### Drawbacks:
- It was resource-heavy and much slower as the number of websites increased, making it inefficient for large-scale scraping.

## 4. Playwright

### What I Did:
I adopted `Playwright` for its speed and efficiency over `Selenium` and `pyppeteer`. This tool enabled scraping across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with better performance and memory usage. I also integrated it into a system for scraping large-scale dynamic content.

### Code Example:
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    content = page.content()
    browser.close()
```

### Results:
- Significant performance improvement over previous tools.
- Encountered issues with memory leaks during prolonged scraping sessions.
- Continued challenges bypassing Cloudflare and anti-bot mechanisms.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Problem:
Some websites were protected by Cloudflare or other advanced anti-bot systems, which blocked scraping attempts.
