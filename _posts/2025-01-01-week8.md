In the eighth week of my internship, the construction progressed with work focused on the second-floor columns and initial preparations for the second-floor slab. Here's an outline of the activities:

### **1. Concrete Pouring for Second-Floor Columns:**
We completed the concrete pouring for the second-floor columns. These columns were reinforced with **16mm and 20mm TMT bars** and followed the same procedure as the previous ones. Around **60 cubic meters** of M25 grade concrete was used for this task. Proper alignment and compaction were ensured to maintain structural integrity.

### **2. Formwork and Reinforcement for Second-Floor Slab:**
Simultaneously, the formwork and reinforcement for the second-floor slab were being set up. The slab thickness remained **200mm**, and reinforcement bars were placed in a **200mm x 200mm** grid pattern using **12mm TMT bars**. Additional reinforcement was added around high-load areas, including elevator shafts and staircases.

### **3. Curing Process for Second-Floor Columns:**
Once the concrete was poured for the second-floor columns, the curing process began immediately. The columns were covered and kept moist with regular water sprinkling to ensure proper hydration.

### **4. Material Management and Logistics:**
I worked closely with the procurement team to ensure timely delivery of materials for the upcoming second-floor slab pouring. This included additional **250 cubic meters of concrete** and **100 tons of steel** to support the ongoing work.

### **5. Coordination with MEP Teams:**
The MEP teams continued installing conduits and piping for the second-floor services. This coordination ensured that the services would be seamlessly integrated into the slab, reducing the need for alterations later.

### **6. Site Safety and Progress Review:**
Regular safety inspections were conducted, particularly focusing on scaffolding stability and protective measures for workers at higher levels. Weekly progress meetings were held to assess the construction timeline and address any potential delays.

By the end of Week 8, the second-floor columns were complete, and preparations for the slab were in the final stages, keeping the project on track for the following weeks.
