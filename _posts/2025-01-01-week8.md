**Week 8 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

Week 8 marked a significant turning point in the internship as we transitioned from the planning and preparation stages into the early stages of physical construction. While much of the groundwork had already been laid in terms of logistics and design, this week focused on the practical execution of the project.

The first major task of the week was overseeing the commencement of foundation work. The site preparation had been completed in previous weeks, and the construction team was now ready to begin laying the foundations for the shopping mall. I spent a lot of time on-site this week, working with the engineers and construction workers to ensure that the excavation for the foundation was proceeding according to plan. We ran several checks to ensure the soil stability and compaction were up to the required standards before pouring the concrete for the foundations.

Once the excavation was completed, we began the process of laying the foundation. This was a critical phase, as the foundation would support the entire structure of the mall. I helped monitor the concrete pouring process, ensuring that the mixture was prepared correctly and applied evenly. The senior engineers and I also worked together to review the placement of reinforcement bars (rebar) in the foundation to ensure it would provide the necessary support for the structure above.

At the same time, we started coordinating the installation of utility lines, such as water and sewage, which needed to be laid below the foundation. This involved coordinating with the plumbing and civil teams to ensure the proper placement and installation of the underground utility infrastructure. We mapped out the key areas where these utilities would connect to the building, ensuring they were accessible and in line with the overall site layout.

While the foundation work was underway, I also continued to liaise with the procurement team to make sure that the materials needed for the next stages of construction, such as steel beams and concrete, were being delivered on schedule. We faced some minor delays with the delivery of certain materials due to supply chain issues, but we built contingency plans to mitigate any significant impacts on the timeline.

In parallel with the on-site work, I revisited the structural drawings to ensure that the vertical elements of the mall (columns and beams) were ready to be implemented once the foundation was complete. I also spent time reviewing the floor plans and coordinating with the electrical and mechanical teams to confirm the placement of utility conduits in the lower levels of the building.

By the end of Week 8, the foundation work was well underway, and we were beginning to prepare for the next stage of construction, which involved erecting the structural framework. This was a crucial week as the physical work on the site had officially begun, and I was heavily involved in ensuring that everything progressed according to plan.
