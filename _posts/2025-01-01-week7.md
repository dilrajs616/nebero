In the seventh week of my internship, the focus shifted to completing the first-floor slab and continuing work on the structural framework. Here's a brief overview of the activities:

### **1. First-Floor Slab Concrete Pouring:**
We successfully completed the concrete pouring for the first-floor slab. The slab was **200mm thick**, and we used approximately **400 cubic meters** of M25 grade concrete. The pouring process was done in stages to ensure even distribution, with proper vibration and compaction to avoid voids. The curing process began immediately after the concrete was set.

### **2. Curing and Column Formwork Removal:**
The columns that were poured in Week 6 were fully cured, and the formwork was removed. The concrete was inspected, and the surfaces were smooth, with no significant defects. Curing of the first-floor slab continued with water sprinkling and covering to maintain moisture.

### **3. Reinforcement for Second-Floor Columns:**
Preparation of steel reinforcement for the second-floor columns was started. The columns were designed with **16mm and 20mm TMT bars**, and the steel cages were assembled and placed in position for the upcoming concrete pour.

### **4. Coordination with Electrical and Plumbing:**
We continued coordinating with the MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) teams to ensure all conduits and piping were installed within the first-floor slab. This ensured that no structural changes would be needed later to accommodate services.

### **5. Site Cleanup and Safety:**
A major cleanup of the work area was done to remove debris and leftover materials. Safety checks were conducted, with a focus on fall protection for workers on higher levels.

By the end of Week 7, the first-floor slab was complete, and preparations for the second floor were well underway.
