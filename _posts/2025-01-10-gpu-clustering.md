title: "Clustering on GPU: CUDA, cuML, and Requirements for Machine Learning"
---

## Overview

As part of our optimization efforts, I leveraged **GPU acceleration** to improve clustering performance. This involved integrating **CUDA**, NVIDIA’s parallel computing platform, and **cuML**, part of the **RAPIDS** ecosystem for GPU-accelerated machine learning. Additional tools like **cuDF** and **cuPy** were essential for efficient data manipulation on GPUs.

## CUDA for Machine Learning

**CUDA** allows developers to harness GPU power for parallelized tasks. Key advantages include:

1. **Parallelism**: GPUs have thousands of cores, enabling fast, parallel execution.
2. **Speed**: Offloading CPU tasks to the GPU significantly accelerates matrix operations and clustering algorithms like K-Means.

## Using cuML for GPU-Accelerated Machine Learning

I replaced **scikit-learn** with **cuML** for clustering. Key differences:

| Feature               | cuML (GPU)                  | scikit-learn (CPU)          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Backend**            | CUDA                        | CPU                         |
| **Performance**        | Faster for large datasets   | Slower                      |
| **API Compatibility**  | Scikit-learn-like API       | Native                      |

### Example: K-Means on GPU with cuML

```python
import cuml
from cuml.cluster import KMeans as cuKMeans
import cudf

data = cudf.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]})
kmeans = cuKMeans(n_clusters=2)
kmeans.fit(data)
print(kmeans.labels_)
```

This demonstrated significant time savings compared to CPU-based implementations.

## Key Libraries

### cuDF: GPU DataFrames

For fast data manipulation on GPUs, I used **cuDF**—a GPU-accelerated DataFrame library similar to pandas.

#### Example: Using cuDF for Data Manipulation

```python
import cudf

gdf = cudf.DataFrame({'a': [10, 20, 30], 'b': [60, 70, 80]})
gdf['c'] = gdf['a'] + gdf['b']
print(gdf)
```

### cuPy: GPU-Accelerated NumPy

**cuPy** was used for matrix operations.

#### Example: cuPy for Matrix Operations

```python
import cupy as cp

a = cp.array([1, 2, 3])
b = cp.array([10, 20, 30])
print(a + b)
```

## GPU Setup Requirements

- **NVIDIA GPU** (e.g., RTX 4090)
- **CUDA Toolkit** for GPU computation
- **RAPIDS** and **cuML** installation via Conda:
  ```bash
  conda install -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge cuml python=3.8 cudatoolkit=11.2
  ```

### **Important Installation Notes for cuML**

Although cuML’s official documentation recommends installing it using **Anaconda RAPIDS**, this method often results in multiple errors. Here’s the correct approach to installing **cuML**:

1. **Install CUDA Toolkit**: 
   - Download the CUDA Toolkit from [NVIDIA's official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). It is recommended to install it using the **runfile** option.
   - Uninstall any pre-installed or previously installed graphics drivers to avoid conflicts.
   - Remove the file `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf` as it prevents successful installation of the drivers bundled with CUDA Toolkit.

2. **Stop GUI Processes**:
   - Before installation, stop all processes that might be running a GUI, including **XOrg**.
   - To do this, switch to **TTY mode** by pressing `Alt+F<1-10>` (this can vary based on your system, for mine it was `Alt+F3`).

3. **Install CUDA Toolkit**:
   - After stopping XOrg and switching to TTY mode, proceed with installing **CUDA Toolkit 12.8**.

4. **Install cuML 12.x**:
   - Once the toolkit is installed, **cuML 12.x** can be easily installed using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install cuml-cu12
     ```

This process ensures proper installation and compatibility with **cuML** for GPU-accelerated machine learning tasks.

### Considerations:

1. **Memory Constraints**: GPUs have limited memory (e.g., 24 GB for RTX 4090), so datasets must fit within this.
2. **Data Transfer Overhead**: Keep operations on the GPU to avoid costly CPU-GPU data transfers.
