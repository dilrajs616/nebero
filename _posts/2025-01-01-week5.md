In the fifth week of my internship, we moved into the construction phase with the pouring of the raft foundation for the shopping mall. This was a major milestone, as it marked the beginning of the physical construction work after weeks of planning and preparation. Hereâ€™s an overview of the progress made during Week 5:

### **1. Pouring the Raft Foundation:**
The primary focus of this week was the successful pouring of the concrete for the **1.5-meter thick raft foundation**. The process was carried out in two continuous shifts over two days to ensure the concrete was poured evenly and without any cold joints. We utilized **M25 grade concrete** as planned, and approximately **1500 cubic meters** of concrete were poured into the foundation. I monitored the process closely, ensuring that the concrete was evenly spread and vibrated to eliminate any air pockets.

### **2. Curing Process:**
Once the foundation was poured, the curing process began immediately to ensure the concrete would gain the required strength. We applied water to the surface and covered the foundation with plastic sheets to prevent rapid evaporation and ensure proper hydration. The curing process was planned for a minimum of **14 days**, during which periodic checks would be performed to ensure optimal conditions.

### **3. Quality Control and Testing:**
To ensure the quality of the foundation, I was involved in testing the compressive strength of the concrete. Concrete cubes were taken during the pouring process and sent to the lab for testing at **7 days** and **28 days**. The **7-day strength** results came back within acceptable limits, showing around **65% of the final required strength**, which indicated that the foundation was curing properly.

### **4. Reinforcement for Columns:**
While the foundation was curing, we shifted focus to the preparation of the steel reinforcement for the columns. Based on the column layout and spacing designed in previous weeks, we began cutting and bending the **16mm and 20mm TMT bars** to be used for the column reinforcements. The steel cages for the columns were assembled on-site, and I was responsible for ensuring that the reinforcements matched the structural drawings.

### **5. Formwork for Columns:**
Simultaneously, the formwork for the first set of columns was being assembled. The formwork used was **steel shuttering** to ensure smooth and consistent column surfaces. I reviewed the formwork plans to ensure proper alignment with the foundation and that it adhered to the structural design requirements. The formwork was designed to allow for easy dismantling after the concrete had set.

### **6. Site Coordination and Logistics:**
Given the increased activity on-site, I helped in coordinating the logistics, including the delivery of materials and equipment. Regular deliveries of concrete, steel, and other essential materials were scheduled to ensure no delays in construction. I also worked closely with the site supervisor to monitor progress and ensure that the work remained on schedule.

### **7. Safety Checks:**
As construction intensified, we revisited site safety protocols. I conducted safety briefings with the workers, focusing on the handling of heavy machinery and working with reinforced steel. Protective gear was distributed, and we ensured that safety measures, such as scaffolding and harnesses, were in place for workers handling higher sections of the formwork.

### **Conclusion:**
Week 5 marked the completion of the foundation pouring and set the stage for erecting the columns. With the curing process underway and reinforcement preparations for the columns in progress, the project moved into the next phase of building the vertical structure. This week represented a significant leap in the construction process, with physical work now visible on-site.
