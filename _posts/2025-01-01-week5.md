**Week 5 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

In the fifth week of my internship, I shifted focus to the refinement of the structural plans and began collaborating more closely with the construction and procurement teams to ensure that the design and planning efforts were practical and aligned with the project’s timeline and budget.

At the start of the week, I worked on incorporating the feedback from the previous week's review regarding the structural reinforcements, especially for the roof and upper floors. The roof needed additional supports to accommodate the weight of HVAC units, solar panels, and any potential rooftop features, such as a garden or seating area. I made adjustments to the column and beam placements to distribute the load more evenly and avoid stress points that could cause structural issues in the long run.

Once these changes were made, I updated the structural drawings and had another round of discussions with the senior engineers. We ran a few more simulations to test the new layout for load distribution and structural stability. Thankfully, the revised plans showed improvements, and the designs for the roof structure were approved for further development.

Another major focus this week was on refining the material selection for various parts of the mall. Having received feedback on my initial proposals, I began researching suppliers and materials that would meet both the aesthetic requirements and the project’s budget constraints. I met with the procurement team to discuss potential suppliers for flooring, glass, and other materials. We worked on getting quotes for the various materials to ensure that the final selection would fit within the budget.

In addition to material discussions, I also started working with the construction team to understand the phasing of the construction work. This was important because the sequence in which different parts of the mall would be built had to be carefully planned to avoid delays. For example, we needed to ensure that structural work for the upper floors could proceed without waiting for all the internal fit-outs to be completed on the lower floors. I began developing a rough construction timeline to outline which parts of the mall would be completed first and what dependencies existed between the various stages of construction.

Midweek, I attended a meeting with the electrical and plumbing teams to finalize the routing of utility systems. The placement of electrical wiring, water pipes, and drainage systems needed to be coordinated so that installation could proceed smoothly during the construction phase. We identified key areas where revisions were needed, especially around the placement of power outlets in the food court and entertainment areas. I updated the plans to reflect these changes and shared the revised versions with the team.

Towards the end of the week, I revisited the 3D model of the mall in Revit to ensure that all changes to the structural layout, utility systems, and material selection were accurately reflected in the design. The 3D model continued to serve as a valuable tool for visualizing the progress and identifying any potential design issues before moving forward.

Overall, Week 5 was a productive week focused on making sure that the project’s design and planning efforts were aligned with real-world considerations like budget, construction phasing, and material sourcing. The project was progressing steadily, but there was still plenty of work left in refining details and coordinating with different teams to ensure everything was on track for the weeks ahead.
