**Week 9 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

In Week 9, the project continued to gain momentum as we progressed with the structural work of the shopping mall. With the foundation nearing completion, this week focused on beginning the vertical construction, particularly the installation of columns and beams that would form the skeleton of the building.

At the beginning of the week, I assisted with the final inspections of the foundation. The concrete had cured properly, and the engineering team conducted load tests to ensure that the foundation could support the weight of the mall's superstructure. After receiving approval from the senior engineers, we moved on to the next phase: erecting the steel columns and beams.

The first major task was coordinating the delivery and installation of the steel framework. I worked closely with the structural engineers and construction crew to ensure that the steel components were installed according to the structural drawings. This involved positioning the steel columns at specific points marked on the foundation, which would support the building's vertical loads. The columns were then connected by horizontal steel beams, which would provide lateral stability to the structure.

Throughout the week, I was responsible for overseeing the alignment and leveling of the columns to ensure that the structure was perfectly vertical. We used laser levels and other precision tools to check that the columns were aligned correctly. Any discrepancies were corrected on-site before the columns were permanently secured in place. This part of the construction was critical, as even minor misalignments could lead to issues with the overall structure as more floors were added.

Another focus of the week was ensuring that safety protocols were strictly followed on-site. Since we were working with heavy steel components and cranes to lift the beams into place, there was an increased risk of accidents. I worked with the safety officer to review the safety measures, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), crane operations, and fall protection for workers operating at heights. We conducted a safety briefing with the construction team each morning to ensure that everyone was aware of the procedures.

Midweek, I also assisted with coordinating the installation of utility conduits and electrical lines that would be embedded in the building's structure. This involved working with the electrical and plumbing teams to ensure that all necessary ducts and pipes were placed before the concrete slabs for the floors were poured. We also mapped out the placement of these utilities to align with the buildingâ€™s mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) plans.

By the end of Week 9, the structural framework for the first few levels of the mall was beginning to take shape. Several columns and beams were already in place, and the construction crew was preparing to move on to the next levels in the coming weeks. The project was progressing well, with the timeline remaining on track despite minor challenges with material deliveries and weather conditions.

Overall, Week 9 was an exciting and productive week as we began to see the physical structure of the mall starting to rise above the ground, marking a major milestone in the construction process.second-floor slab was fully completed, and the groundwork for the third-floor columns was in place, keeping the project on schedule.
