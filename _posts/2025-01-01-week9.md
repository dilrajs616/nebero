In the ninth week of my internship, the focus was on completing the second-floor slab and moving forward with preparations for the third-floor columns. Below is a summary of the main activities:

### **1. Concrete Pouring for the Second-Floor Slab:**
We completed the concrete pouring for the second-floor slab, which covered a large area. The slab thickness remained **200mm**, and approximately **350 cubic meters** of M25 grade concrete was used. The pouring was done in sections, ensuring that proper compaction and finishing were achieved using vibrators. The curing process began immediately after the slab was set, with continuous water curing to maintain moisture for proper hydration.

### **2. Formwork Removal and Inspection:**
Once the slab for the second floor was set, the formwork from the first-floor columns was fully removed. I assisted in inspecting the slab and columns for any visible defects or issues. Everything was in good condition, with smooth surfaces and no cracks, indicating that the pouring process was successful.

### **3. Preparation for Third-Floor Columns:**
The formwork and steel reinforcement for the third-floor columns were prepared. These columns were similar in size and design to the previous ones, using **16mm and 20mm TMT bars** for reinforcement. The steel cages were assembled and placed in position, ready for the upcoming concrete pour.

### **4. Electrical and Plumbing Installation for Second Floor:**
Coordination with the MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) teams continued as they installed conduits and piping for the second-floor services. Special attention was given to ensuring that all necessary provisions were made for HVAC systems, electrical wiring, and plumbing, particularly around the service areas and restrooms.

### **5. Material Management and Planning:**
I worked with the site supervisors to review the stock of materials needed for the third-floor construction. Additional **50 tons of steel** and **300 cubic meters of concrete** were ordered to ensure the project progressed without any delays.

### **6. Safety Protocols:**
Safety measures were continuously monitored, especially for workers operating on the second and third floors. This included checking the stability of scaffolding, ensuring workers were using safety harnesses, and installing additional guardrails along the open edges of the slab.

By the end of Week 9, the second-floor slab was fully completed, and the groundwork for the third-floor columns was in place, keeping the project on schedule.
