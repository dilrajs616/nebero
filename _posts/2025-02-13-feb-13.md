# Daily Report: Facebook Zero Shot Model - CPU vs GPU Performance Testing

## Overview

Today, we focused on testing the performance of the **Facebook Zero Shot model** (1.7 GB in size), specifically comparing its processing time on a CPU versus a GPU. The purpose of this test was to understand the time efficiency of using a GPU for handling website data and determine if upgrading our hardware setup would be beneficial for future projects.

## Performance Testing Results

### **CPU Performance**
- On the CPU, the processing time per website was significantly higher. We observed that it took **around 30 seconds per website** to run the model. While this is manageable for smaller workloads, it would be inefficient for large-scale processing, especially with multiple websites being scraped in parallel.

### **GPU Performance**
- After testing the model on a GPU, we saw a dramatic improvement in processing speed. The model processed each website in **just 4 seconds**, which is an 85% reduction in processing time compared to the CPU.
- This significant performance boost clearly highlights the advantages of using a GPU for our tasks, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

## GPU Upgrade Plan

Based on the test results and the clear need for better processing speed, we have decided to upgrade our system with a **high-performance GPU**. Today, we finalized our decision and **ordered an RTX 4090 GPU** to be installed in the system. This will enable us to handle larger datasets more efficiently and speed up the overall processing time.

### Expected Benefits:
- **Faster Processing Times**: With the RTX 4090, we expect to further reduce the time per website, allowing us to handle more websites simultaneously.
- **Increased Efficiency**: With the enhanced performance, we will be able to scale up our model's usage and process large amounts of data much more quickly.
- **Future-Proofing**: The RTX 4090 will also help future-proof our setup for any additional models or workloads that require high-performance GPU usage.

## Next Steps
- **Hardware Installation**: Once the RTX 4090 GPU arrives, we will install it in the system and configure it for optimal performance.
- **Further Testing**: After the GPU is set up, we will continue testing to ensure that the model performs as expected in real-world scenarios.
- **Scaling Up**: With the enhanced speed, we will begin scaling up the project to process more websites and refine the categorization process for the company.

## Conclusion
Today's performance tests clearly demonstrated the power of using a GPU for this project. The move to an **RTX 4090** will not only drastically improve processing times but also pave the way for smoother scaling of the system. We are excited to move forward with this upgrade and look forward to the enhanced capabilities it will bring.
