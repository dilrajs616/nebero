# Report: Hardware Requirements and GPU Decision for AI Models

## Overview

In the **AI model hardware requirements report** that was sent to CEO Sir yesterday, I outlined the hardware specifications required for running LLaMA3.1 405B model and DeepSeek V3 AI models efficiently. Following are the **minimum and maximum hardware requirements** based on the model's complexity and data processing needs.

- **Highest Hardware Requirements**:  
  - **Graphics Memory**: 800 GB  
  - **RAM**: 2 TB
- **Minimum Hardware Requirements**:  
  - **Graphics Memory**: 150 GB  
  - **RAM**: 320 GB

## Decision on GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4090

After evaluating the hardware requirements in the report and understanding the specific needs for parallel processing of multiple AI models, we have decided to purchase the **NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU**. The decision was influenced by several key features of the 4090 that align with the projectâ€™s requirements and future scalability.

### Why RTX 4090?

1. **NVIDIA VLink Compatibility**:  
   The **RTX 4090** is compatible with **NVIDIA VLink**, a high-bandwidth interconnect technology that allows the use of **multiple GPUs in parallel**. This feature is crucial for handling large-scale AI models and datasets, as it enables seamless communication between GPUs for faster processing. 

   - **Parallel GPU Usage**: This feature allows us to connect multiple RTX 4090 GPUs, effectively increasing processing power without the bottleneck of a single GPU. The **parallel processing** of multiple GPUs will significantly improve the speed of training and inference for complex models.

2. **Higher VRAM Capacity**:  
   The **RTX 4090** comes with **24 GB of dedicated graphics memory (VRAM)**, which is substantial compared to other models in its class. This additional VRAM will be essential for running memory-intensive models like:
   - **LLAMA3 8B 16fp**  
   - **Facebook Zero Shot Model**  
   
   These models require significant VRAM to handle large datasets and process complex computations simultaneously. With 24 GB of VRAM, the RTX 4090 can easily accommodate both models, allowing us to run them at the same time without running into memory limitations.

## Important Concepts and Definitions

### 1. **Graphics Memory (VRAM)**:
   - **VRAM** stands for **Video Random Access Memory**, which is a type of memory used by the GPU to store data that is processed during computation. VRAM is crucial for running AI models as it holds the parameters, weights, and data during training or inference. The more VRAM a GPU has, the larger the models and datasets it can handle.
   - In the context of AI models, **24 GB of VRAM** allows for the simultaneous execution of large models like LLAMA3 and the Facebook Zero Shot model, both of which demand significant memory resources for efficient processing.

### 2. **NVIDIA VLink**:
   - **NVIDIA VLink** is a technology designed to facilitate high-speed communication between multiple GPUs. This allows multiple GPUs to work in parallel, effectively increasing the overall computational power available for tasks such as training deep learning models.
   - VLink enables GPUs to share memory and workloads, improving performance for large-scale AI projects and making it easier to scale up without sacrificing efficiency.

### 3. **LLAMA3 8B 16fp Model**:
   - **LLAMA3** is a variant of a large language model (LLM) that is optimized for high performance in tasks like text generation and natural language understanding. The **8B** in the model's name refers to the **8 billion parameters** it uses, which makes it one of the more computationally demanding models.
   - The **16fp** (16-bit floating point precision) is a reduced-precision format that helps speed up calculations without significantly compromising accuracy. This is important for running large models on GPUs with limited memory.

### 4. **Facebook Zero Shot Model**:
   - The **Facebook Zero Shot Model** is a natural language processing (NLP) model designed to perform a wide range of tasks without requiring task-specific training data. It is capable of generalizing across various domains and tasks, making it highly flexible but also resource-intensive.
   - With **24 GB of VRAM**, the RTX 4090 can run this model alongside LLAMA3, allowing for parallel execution of multiple AI tasks.


## Overview

We also focused on testing the performance of the **Facebook Zero Shot model** (1.7 GB in size), specifically comparing its processing time on a CPU versus a GPU. The purpose of this test was to understand the time efficiency of using a GPU for handling website data and determine if upgrading our hardware setup would be beneficial for future projects.

## Performance Testing Results

### **CPU Performance**
- On the CPU, the processing time per website was significantly higher. We observed that it took **around 30 seconds per website** to run the model. While this is manageable for smaller workloads, it would be inefficient for large-scale processing, especially with multiple websites being scraped in parallel.

### **GPU Performance**
- After testing the model on a GPU, we saw a dramatic improvement in processing speed. The model processed each website in **just 4 seconds**, which is an 85% reduction in processing time compared to the CPU.
- This significant performance boost clearly highlights the advantages of using a GPU for our tasks, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

## GPU Upgrade Plan

Based on the test results and the clear need for better processing speed, we have decided to upgrade our system with a **high-performance GPU**. Today, we finalized our decision and **ordered an RTX 4090 GPU** to be installed in the system. This will enable us to handle larger datasets more efficiently and speed up the overall processing time.

### Expected Benefits:
- **Faster Processing Times**: With the RTX 4090, we expect to further reduce the time per website, allowing us to handle more websites simultaneously.
- **Increased Efficiency**: With the enhanced performance, we will be able to scale up our model's usage and process large amounts of data much more quickly.
- **Future-Proofing**: The RTX 4090 will also help future-proof our setup for any additional models or workloads that require high-performance GPU usage.

## Next Steps
- **Hardware Installation**: Once the RTX 4090 GPU arrives, we will install it in the system and configure it for optimal performance.
- **Further Testing**: After the GPU is set up, we will continue testing to ensure that the model performs as expected in real-world scenarios.
- **Scaling Up**: With the enhanced speed, we will begin scaling up the project to process more websites and refine the categorization process for the company.

## Conclusion
Today's performance tests clearly demonstrated the power of using a GPU for this project. The move to an **RTX 4090** will not only drastically improve processing times but also pave the way for smoother scaling of the system. We are excited to move forward with this upgrade and look forward to the enhanced capabilities it will bring.
