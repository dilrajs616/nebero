title: "Week 3"

In the third week of my internship, I focused on finalizing the foundation design and initiating the structural design of the shopping mall’s superstructure. We progressed from the preliminary calculations of the previous week and began laying out detailed plans for the columns and beams, essential for the overall structural integrity. Here's the summary of the work done:

### **1. Finalizing Foundation Design:**
The foundation design from Week 2 was revisited, and based on additional feedback from the senior engineers, we finalized the thickness of the **raft foundation** to be **1.5 meters** to account for potential settlement and load distribution across the site. I assisted in drafting the final blueprints for the foundation layout, ensuring that column positions aligned perfectly with the overall design plan.

### **2. Column and Beam Layout:**
After completing the foundation work, the next task was to design the **columns** and **beams** that would support the entire structure. Based on the preliminary load calculations, we planned for reinforced concrete columns with dimensions of **600mm x 600mm**, spaced at around **8 meters** apart to optimize load distribution and open space within the mall. The beams were designed to be **300mm x 600mm** for most sections, though we added additional reinforcements in critical load-bearing areas such as near escalators and atriums.

### **3. Structural Load Analysis:**
I worked on calculating the load-bearing capacity of the designed columns and beams. The dead and live loads from Week 2 were distributed across these structural members, and we estimated the maximum load-bearing capacity for each column. The estimated capacity for each column was around **900 kN**, ensuring sufficient strength to handle the cumulative load of the multi-story shopping mall.

### **4. Seismic Considerations:**
Since the area where the mall is being constructed falls under a moderate seismic zone, we started factoring in seismic load requirements. We reviewed seismic load standards (based on IS codes) and began integrating earthquake-resistant features, including flexible joints and shear walls. I performed basic calculations to determine the lateral forces the building might experience during an earthquake and ensured that the design would meet the required safety standards.

### **5. Material Procurement Planning:**
We refined the material estimates based on the finalized foundation, column, and beam design. For the first phase of construction, we planned to order approximately **600 tons** of steel reinforcement bars (TMT bars) for the foundation and structural framework, along with additional **1500 cubic meters** of ready-mix concrete. We also reviewed the timeline for material deliveries to ensure they would align with the construction schedule.

### **6. Coordination with Other Departments:**
Lastly, I coordinated with the architectural and electrical teams to ensure that the structural design would not interfere with other aspects of the mall’s construction, such as HVAC systems, electrical ducting, and interior layouts. This helped in making small adjustments to the placement of columns and beams to allow for seamless integration of other systems later in the project.

Overall, Week 3 was a crucial step in finalizing the structural layout and preparing for the construction phase. With the foundation and structural elements now fully designed, we were ready to move into the next stage of construction planning in the following weeks.
