### **Weekly Internship Report – Week 3**

**Project:** Construction of a Shopping Mall  
**Duration:** 26 Weeks  
**Completed:** 11 Weeks  
**Week 3 Report:** (Duration: 5 Days)

---

#### **Introduction:**

In the third week of my internship, I focused on designing and analyzing the **superstructure** of the shopping mall. Having finalized the foundation design and performed detailed load calculations in the previous week, this week was centered on defining the dimensions, materials, and layouts for the superstructure, including columns, beams, slabs, and roof systems. In addition, a preliminary **structural steel design** for key components such as beams and columns was carried out, using **limit state design principles** in accordance with IS 800:2007.

---

#### **1. Structural Design of the Superstructure:**

##### **1.1 Columns and Beam Layout:**

The structural system selected for the mall was a **reinforced concrete frame structure** due to its high strength, cost-effectiveness, and ease of construction. The design involved creating a grid layout for the columns and beams, providing adequate support and stability for the shopping mall's large floor spans and open spaces.

- **Column Layout:**  
  Columns were placed at regular intervals of **6 meters** in both the **x-direction** and **y-direction**. A grid system with **spans of 6m x 6m** was chosen to accommodate the architectural layout while minimizing bending moments in beams and slabs.

  | Column Grid | Spacing (meters) |
  |-------------|------------------|
  | X-direction | 6                |
  | Y-direction | 6                |

  There were **60 columns** in total for the three-story structure, distributed evenly across the floor plan. The column sizes were determined based on the building's load demands.

  **Column Dimensions:**
  - Ground Floor: **600mm x 600mm** (due to higher load)
  - First and Second Floors: **450mm x 450mm**

  The **axial load** on the columns was calculated by distributing the dead and live loads evenly across the columns.

  **Axial Load Calculation:**

  Assuming the total load per floor is **12,750 kN** (dead + live loads):

  \[
  \text{Axial Load per Column} = \frac{12,750 \, \text{kN}}{60 \, \text{columns}} = 212.5 \, \text{kN/column}
  \]

  Given that the structure has three floors, the total load on ground floor columns would be approximately:

  \[
  \text{Total Load per Column} = 212.5 \, \text{kN} \times 3 = 637.5 \, \text{kN}
  \]

- **Beam Layout:**  
  The beams were designed to span between the columns, with a typical **beam span of 6 meters**. Beams were placed along both the x- and y-directions, ensuring sufficient support for the slab above. Beams were designed to be **300mm x 600mm** for the primary beams, and **300mm x 450mm** for secondary beams to provide proper load distribution.

---

#### **2. Slab Design:**

The slab system for the shopping mall was designed to carry both the dead load (self-weight) and live load (due to occupancy, equipment, and furnishings). The slab type selected was a **one-way reinforced concrete slab**, supported by beams on two opposite sides.

##### **2.1 Slab Thickness Calculation:**

The slab thickness was determined using the following design criteria:

- **Live Load:** 4 kN/m² (as calculated in Week 2)
- **Slab Span:** 6 meters
- **Concrete Grade:** M35
- **Steel Grade:** Fe 500

Based on IS 456:2000, the minimum slab thickness is governed by deflection control criteria. For a simply supported slab with a span of 6 meters, the slab thickness was calculated as:

\[
\text{Minimum Thickness} = \frac{\text{Span}}{20} = \frac{6 \, \text{m}}{20} = 0.3 \, \text{m} = 300 \, \text{mm}
\]

However, a **150 mm thick slab** was adopted based on the **structural load analysis** and reinforcement design, as additional deflection control was provided through proper reinforcement.

##### **2.2 Reinforcement Calculation:**

The reinforcement was designed to resist the bending moment generated by the slab. For the slab, the maximum bending moment was calculated as:

\[
M = \frac{w L^2}{8}
\]

Where:
- \(w = 12.75 \, \text{kN/m²}\) (total load)
- \(L = 6 \, \text{m}\) (span)

\[
M = \frac{12.75 \times (6)^2}{8} = 57.375 \, \text{kN-m}
\]

The reinforcement required was determined using the formula:

\[
A_s = \frac{M}{0.87 f_y d}
\]

Where:
- \(M\) = Bending moment (57.375 kN-m)
- \(f_y\) = Yield strength of steel (500 MPa)
- \(d\) = Effective depth of slab (120 mm)

Substituting the values:

\[
A_s = \frac{57.375 \times 10^6}{0.87 \times 500 \times 120} = 1096.37 \, \text{mm²}
\]

The reinforcement provided was **12 mm diameter bars** at **150 mm spacing** for the tension zone of the slab.

#### **3. Steel Design for Beams and Columns:**

##### **3.1 Beam Design:**

For beams, the design was done using **limit state design principles**, considering both **bending** and **shear forces**. The typical beam size was **300mm x 600mm**, and reinforcement was calculated for both tension and compression zones.

- **Bending Moment for Beam:**
  
  Using a similar formula for maximum bending moment as in slab design, for a beam with a span of 6 meters, total load **w = 12.75 kN/m**, the maximum moment was:

  \[
  M = \frac{12.75 \times (6)^2}{8} = 57.375 \, \text{kN-m}
  \]

  Reinforcement was provided as:

  - **Tension Steel:** 4 bars of 16 mm diameter (ASTM Fe 500)
  - **Compression Steel:** 2 bars of 12 mm diameter

- **Shear Design for Beams:**

  The shear force was calculated as:

  \[
  V = \frac{w L}{2} = \frac{12.75 \times 6}{2} = 38.25 \, \text{kN}
  \]

  Shear reinforcement was provided using **8 mm diameter stirrups** at **200 mm c/c**.

##### **3.2 Column Design:**

For columns, axial loads were calculated in Week 2, and the dimensions selected earlier were **600mm x 600mm** for ground floor columns. Reinforcement was provided as **8 bars of 20 mm diameter** with lateral ties of **10 mm diameter** at **300 mm spacing**.

#### **4. Roof Design:**

The roof of the shopping mall was designed to be a **reinforced concrete flat roof**, with proper drainage systems to handle rainwater. The roof slab thickness was kept at **150 mm** with an additional layer of waterproofing.

To support HVAC systems and other mechanical equipment, additional steel sections were provided to distribute the load evenly across the roof structure.

#### **5. Material Estimation and Costs for Superstructure:**

A **Bill of Quantities (BoQ)** was prepared for the materials required for the superstructure, including columns, beams, and slabs:

| Material          | Quantity (for superstructure) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cement (M35 grade)| 1400 tons                      |
| Steel (Rebars)    | 800 tons                       |
| Aggregate         | 6000 cubic meters              |
| Sand              | 3000 cubic meters              |
| Concrete          | 5000 cubic meters              |

Preliminary cost analysis for the superstructure:

- **Cement:** ₹5,000 per ton → Total = ₹7,000,000
- **Steel (Rebars):** ₹60,000 per ton → Total = ₹48,000,000
- **Concrete:** ₹6,000 per cubic meter → Total = ₹30,000,000

The **total estimated cost** for the superstructure materials amounted to approximately **₹85,000,000**.

#### **6. Use of Software:**

During the week, I made extensive use of **ETABS** and **STAAD Pro** for structural modeling and load simulations. These tools allowed me to optimize the design of the beams, columns, and slabs while ensuring compliance with building codes. By inputting all the load data and material specifications, the software provided stress and deflection results, which were used to refine the reinforcement details.

#### **Conclusion:**

The third week of the internship was focused on the design and analysis of the superstructure. Significant progress was made in defining the column and beam layouts, designing slabs and roofs, and conducting reinforcement calculations. By collaborating with senior engineers, I was able to apply the theoretical knowledge I had gained during my studies to real-world scenarios, ensuring the structure would meet both safety
