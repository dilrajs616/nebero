**Week 3 Report (Internship Duration: 26 weeks, Completed: 11 weeks)**

In the third week of my internship, I transitioned from focusing primarily on the ground floor to working on the design and layout for the upper floors of the shopping mall. The goal was to ensure continuity in design while addressing the different functional needs of each floor. This week was focused on two main areas: floor planning and coordinating with the structural engineering team.

I began by expanding the AutoCAD and Revit models to include the first and second floors. The layout for these floors differed slightly from the ground floor as they would house more specialized areas like entertainment zones (e.g., a cinema or gaming arcade) and food courts. I ensured that the design accommodated a mix of larger open spaces and smaller retail units. The placement of escalators and elevators was also adjusted to make sure they were easily accessible from all parts of the mall, providing a smooth transition between floors.

While working on the upper floor designs, I collaborated closely with the structural engineering team to ensure that the designs I was working on were feasible from a construction standpoint. This involved reviewing the locations of load-bearing walls, columns, and beams, and understanding how the structural components would support the weight of the floors above. We discussed the placement of columns to ensure that they didn't interfere with the flow of foot traffic or the layout of retail units. I also worked with the team to make initial calculations for the load-bearing capacities and distributed loads, making sure that the design could accommodate not only the physical structure but also the anticipated crowd levels.

In addition, I coordinated with the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) teams to ensure that the plans for utilities like HVAC, water supply, and drainage systems were consistent across all floors. We mapped out the vertical shafts where these systems would be routed, ensuring that the placement did not interfere with commercial spaces or customer flow. Special attention was given to the placement of fire exits, sprinkler systems, and emergency lighting, as safety remained a top priority.

Mid-week, I attended a review meeting with the senior project managers where we discussed the overall progress and some of the challenges I faced in the upper floor designs. One of the main points of discussion was the allocation of space for the food court, which required careful planning to ensure that it was located in a central area, with enough seating capacity while maintaining proper ventilation and natural light. Based on the feedback, I made adjustments to the seating arrangement and space for food stalls.

Towards the end of the week, I began planning for the roof layout, which would include utility spaces such as HVAC units and potential solar panel installation. I also reviewed options for a rooftop garden or terrace, which the project manager suggested as a potential feature to enhance the overall appeal of the mall.

By the close of the week, I had made good progress on the first and second-floor layouts and identified key areas where further refinement would be needed. I also set up a schedule for the following week to continue working on the structural details and to begin working on the finishing elements, such as floor materials, lighting, and signage.

Overall, Week 3 was a productive one, with substantial progress on the upper floors and stronger coordination between architectural design and structural engineering requirements. However, more detailed work was still needed in terms of finalizing layouts and ensuring all systems were well integrated.
