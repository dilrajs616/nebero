## Overview

This document outlines the **keyword extraction** process used in the automated website categorization pipeline. The objective is to extract the most relevant keywords from website content to support categorization.

## Chosen Method: TF-IDF

We chose **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** for keyword extraction due to its balance between efficiency and relevance. Although more advanced methods like **BERT** were explored, they proved too resource-intensive for our large-scale use case.

### Advantages of TF-IDF:
- **Efficiency**: Computationally lightweight compared to deep learning models.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and interpret.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets effectively.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The website content undergoes the following transformations:
   - **Tokenization**: Split text into words (tokens).
   - **Stop-word Removal**: Remove common words like "the", "is".
   - **Lowercasing**: Convert text to lowercase for consistency.
   - **Punctuation Removal**: Eliminate punctuation and special characters.
   - **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

2. **TF-IDF Calculation**:  
   For each term in a document:
   - **Term Frequency (TF)**: Frequency of the term in the document.
   - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Rarity of the term across all documents.

3. **Ranking and Selection**: 
   Rank terms by their **TF-IDF scores** and select top keywords.

## Example Workflow

### Input:  
Website content:  
**"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries. AI models are powerful."**

### Preprocessing Result:  
**["artificial", "intelligence", "ai", "transforming", "industries", "models", "powerful"]**

### Vectorization:

| Term       | TF-IDF Score |
|------------|--------------|
| AI         | 0.5          |
| models     | 0.7          |
| powerful   | 0.5          |

The top keywords would be "models", "AI", and "powerful."
